# Federal Budget & Taxpayer Welfare — Preliminary Findings

**Analysis Date:** February 2026  
**Status:** Preliminary (FY2025 data still accumulating)  
**Pre-registration:** See `docs/hypothesis_preregistration.md`

---

## Master Hypothesis

> **H1:** The bottom 50% of taxpayers are worse off in 2025 due to federal economic policy.

## Key Findings

### H1a: Social Program Spending

| Program | FY2023 | FY2024 | Change |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Social Security | $1,348B | $1,454B | +7.9% |
| Medicaid | $616B | $618B | +0.3% |
| **Income Security (SNAP, EITC, etc.)** | **$448B** | **$370B** | **−17.4%** |
| Veterans' Programs | $170B | $192B | +12.5% |

**Key finding:** Income security programs (SNAP, EITC, child tax credits, etc.) dropped **$78B** (−17.4%) in a single year. As a share of GDP, income security fell from **1.6% → 1.3%** (−21.8%), the steepest annual decline in the dataset. This disproportionately affects the bottom 50%.

Since FY2020, income security spending has fallen **$681B** (−65%) — from $1,051B at the pandemic peak to $370B. While some normalization is expected post-COVID, the level is now **below FY2019 ($486B)** in nominal terms.

**ITS Result:** The interrupted time series around January 20, 2025 found a **statistically significant** positive level shift in total social benefits (p = 0.026) but a **negative trend change** (−39.1 per quarter, p = 0.095). The positive level may reflect automatic inflation adjustments; the negative trend suggests decelerating growth.

### H1b: Tax Burden Distribution

| Revenue Source | FY2023 | FY2024 | Change |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Individual Income Tax | $2,177B | $2,426B | +11.5% |
| Corporate Income Tax | $420B | $530B | +26.3% |
| Payroll Tax (regressive) | $1,615B | $1,709B | +5.9% |
| Excise Tax (regressive) | $76B | $101B | +33.8% |
| Customs/Tariffs | $80B | $77B | −4.1% |

**Regressive tax share (payroll + excise + customs):**
- FY2023: 39.9% of total revenue
- FY2024: 38.4% of total revenue (−1.5pp)

The data shows a **slight progressive shift** in FY2024, but this will reverse in FY2025 when the tariff spike hits:

**FY2025 customs revenue: $195B (+153% YoY)** — this $118B increase in tariff revenue falls disproportionately on consumers of imported goods, functioning as a **regressive sales tax**.

**Gini coefficient:** 0.456 (2024), near the range high of 0.462.

### H1c: Tariffs as Regressive Tax

**CPI changes around the 2025 tariff implementation:**

| Category | Pre-Tariff Avg | Post-Tariff Avg | Change |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| All Items | 315.2 | 323.0 | +2.46% |
| **Shelter** | **403.4** | **416.8** | **+3.33%** |
| **Medical Care** | **566.4** | **582.6** | **+2.86%** |
| Food at Home | 307.5 | 314.2 | +2.17% |
| Education | 146.2 | 146.9 | +0.50% |
| Apparel | 131.6 | 131.7 | +0.07% |
| Gasoline | 294.9 | 275.9 | −6.45% |

**Key finding:** Shelter (+3.33%) and medical care (+2.86%) — the two largest unavoidable expenses for lower-income households — are rising faster than overall CPI. Gasoline fell (oil market dynamics), but essentials that consume a larger share of low-income budgets are inflating faster.

**ITS on CPI around reciprocal tariffs (April 2, 2025):** p = 0.008 — **statistically significant** structural shift detected, though the immediate measured effect was slightly negative (likely reflecting gasoline offset).

**CBO customs revenue FY2025: $195B** — more than double FY2024, confirming massive tariff collection increase.

### H1d: Deficit, Debt Service & Bondholder Enrichment

| Metric | FY2023 | FY2024 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Total Revenue | $4,441B | $4,920B | +10.8% |
| Total Outlays | $6,135B | $6,751B | +10.0% |
| **Net Interest** | **$658B** | **$880B** | **+33.7%** |
| Debt Held by Public | $26,236B | $28,196B | +7.5% |

**Critical finding — Interest payments now rival safety-net spending:**
- Net interest: **$880B**
- Income security + Medicaid: **$988B**
- Ratio: **89.1%** — interest payments are approaching parity with the core safety net.

**Interest as % of GDP:** 1.6% (2020) → 3.0% (2024) → 3.2% (2025) — the highest level since the early 1990s and rising rapidly.

**30-Year Treasury yield:** 4.70% (+0.62pp since Jan 2024) — higher yields mean even more federal dollars flow to bondholders (primarily high-net-worth individuals and institutions).

**Revenue−Outlays gap (deficit):**

| Year | Deficit |
|------|---------|
| FY2020 | −$3,132B |
| FY2021 | −$2,775B |
| FY2022 | −$1,376B |
| FY2023 | −$1,694B |
| FY2024 | −$1,831B |

### H1e: Corporate & Shareholder Benefits

**Corporate vs Individual tax ratio (corp tax as % of individual):**

| Year | Ratio |
|------|-------|
| FY2021 | 18.2% |
| FY2022 | 16.1% |
| FY2023 | 19.3% |
| FY2024 | 21.8% |
| FY2025 | 17.0% |

**CBO Economic Projections (2023 → 2024):**

| Metric | 2023 | 2024 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Wages & Salaries | $11,732B | $12,388B | +5.6% |
| Corporate Profits | $3,617B | $3,802B | +5.1% |
| Dividend Income | $2,147B | $2,219B | +3.3% |

**S&P 500:** +80.7% since January 2023 — gains accruing primarily to the top 10% who hold ~93% of equities.

## Budget Flow: Where Did the Money Go? (FY2020 → FY2024)

| Category | FY2020 | FY2024 | $ Change |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Net Interest** | **$345B** | **$880B** | **+$534B (+155%)** |
| Social Security | $1,090B | $1,454B | +$364B (+33%) |
| Discretionary | $1,628B | $1,810B | +$182B (+11%) |
| Medicaid | $458B | $618B | +$159B (+35%) |
| Veterans | $122B | $192B | +$70B (+57%) |
| **Income Security** | **$1,051B** | **$370B** | **−$681B (−65%)** |

**The two starkest movements:**
1. **Net interest grew $534B** — the single largest dollar increase of any spending category
2. **Income security fell $681B** — the largest decline, removing pandemic-era support

In effect, **$534B shifted from productive government functions to debt servicing (bondholder payments)**, while the programs most targeted at the bottom 50% (SNAP, refundable tax credits, unemployment insurance) were cut by two-thirds.

## Assessment Summary

| Sub-Hypothesis | Direction | Statistical Significance | Strength |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------------|----------|
| H1a: Social program cuts | **Mixed** — Income security down sharply, Social Security up | ITS p=0.026 (significant) | Moderate |
| H1b: Regressive tax shift | **Nuanced** — FY2024 slightly progressive, but FY2025 tariffs reverse this | FY2025 customs +153% | Moderate |
| H1c: Tariff price impact | **Supported** — Essentials rising faster than overall CPI | ITS p=0.008 (significant) | Strong |
| H1d: Interest crowds out spending | **Strongly supported** — Interest at 89% of safety-net level | — | Strong |
| H1e: Shareholder benefits | **Supported** — S&P +81%, equities concentrated in top 10% | — | Moderate |

### Overall

The evidence **partially supports** the master hypothesis with important nuances:

1. **Income security** (SNAP, EITC, child credits) is the clearest channel of harm — spending fell $681B since 2020 and is now below pre-pandemic nominal levels.
2. **Rising interest payments** ($880B) are the largest structural shift, redirecting federal resources from services to bondholders (who are disproportionately wealthy).
3. **Tariffs** function as a regressive tax — customs revenue more than doubled in FY2025, and essential goods prices are rising faster than luxury goods.
4. Social Security and Medicare are still growing, partially offsetting H1a for retirees.
5. Full FY2025 data (especially post-April tariffs) will be needed for definitive conclusions.

## NEW: CPS ASEC 2024 Microdata Analysis

**Source:** Census Bureau API — CPS Annual Social & Economic Supplement 2024  
**Coverage:** 115,836 persons (15+), 273M weighted population, 51 states, 81 variables  
**Income Reference Year:** Calendar Year 2023

### Income Distribution (Piketty-Saez-Zucman Framework)

| Group | Pre-Tax Income Share | Post-Tax Income Share | Capital Income Share |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Bottom 50% | 11.1% | 12.0% | −0.1% |
| Middle 40% | 47.3% | 48.1% | 9.0% |
| Top 10% | 41.6% | 39.9% | 91.1% |
| Top 1% | 11.9% | 11.1% | 42.8% |

**Key:** The top 10% holds 91.1% of capital income — any tariff refund windfall (flowing to corporate shareholders) would further concentrate income at the top.

### Quintile-Level Income & Tax Burdens

## NEW: Granular Tariff Incidence Analysis

### Did Tariff-Affected Goods See Real Price Increases?

Using CPI sub-indices from FRED (through January 2026), we measure price acceleration in tariff-affected categories vs. headline CPI. The "tariff-period bump" compares average CPI levels Apr 2025+ to the Oct 2024–Jan 2025 pre-tariff baseline:

| Goods Category | Tariff Rate | Pre-Tariff YoY | Post-Tariff YoY | Acceleration | Tariff-Period Bump |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Consumer Electronics** | 10–145% | −6.05% | +1.57% | **+7.61pp** | +1.61% |
| **Household Furnishings** | 10–145% | +0.48% | +3.93% | **+3.46pp** | +3.19% |
| **Toys and Games** | 10–145% | +3.71% | +5.54% | **+1.84pp** | +3.65% |
| **Footwear** | 10–145% | +1.03% | +1.95% | +0.93pp | +0.15% |
| **New Vehicles** | 25% | −0.34% | +0.37% | +0.71pp | +0.30% |
| **Used Vehicles** | indirect | +0.93% | −1.96% | −2.89pp | +1.82% |
| **Food at Home** | 10–25% | +1.84% | +2.18% | +0.33pp | +1.62% |
| **Food Away from Home** | indirect | +3.38% | +3.98% | +0.60pp | +2.95% |
| Gasoline | 10–25% | −0.13% | −7.49% | −7.37pp | −4.54% |
| Headline CPI-U | — | 2.99% | 2.39% | −0.60pp | — |

**Key finding:** High-tariff consumer goods (>15% effective rate) saw **+2.30pp mean acceleration** vs **−1.46pp for low-tariff goods** — a **3.76pp differential** consistent with tariff pass-through. The Spearman rank correlation between tariff rate and price acceleration is **ρ = 0.684 (p = 0.020)**, statistically significant.

Consumer electronics — the most China-dependent category — saw the largest reversal: from **−6.05% deflation** (pre-tariff) to **+1.57% inflation** (post-tariff), a **7.6 percentage-point swing**. Household furnishings (+3.19% bump) and toys (+3.65% bump) also show clear tariff effects.

### B50 Expenditure Alignment with Tariff-Affected Goods

Using BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) 2023 quintile tables, the tariff burden per consumer unit is:

| Quintile | Annual Tariff Cost | As % of After-Tax Income |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Q1 (Bottom 20%)** | **$155** | **1.05%** |
| **Q2** | **$193** | **0.57%** |
| Q3 | $237 | 0.43% |
| Q4 | $300 | 0.35% |
| Q5 (Top 20%) | $512 | 0.28% |

**Regressivity ratio: 3.8×** — Q1 pays 3.8× the income share of Q5. Tariffs function as a deeply regressive consumption tax.

Largest B50 cost drivers:
- **Food at home** ($71–83/yr per CU) — staple groceries hit by Canada/Mexico tariffs
- **Food away from home** ($66–88/yr) — ingredient cost pass-through
- **Household furnishings** ($21–32/yr) — China-sourced furniture/housewares
- **Used vehicles** ($23–31/yr) — substitution effects from new vehicle tariffs
- Gasoline provided a **partial offset** (−$56 to −$83) from falling oil prices

### B50 Share of Total Tariff Revenue

Weighting CEX spending by category-specific effective tariff rates:

| Measure | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Total tariff-weighted consumer spending | $451.7B |
| **B50 share (Q1+Q2+¼×Q3)** | **28.8%** |
| B40 share (Q1+Q2 only) | 24.3% |
| T20 share (Q5) | 34.7% |
| **B50 paid (of $195B tariff revenue)** | **$56.2B** |
| **B50 paid (of $100B above CBO baseline)** | **$28.8B** |
| Per person (B50 pop = 136.6M) | $411 total / $211 above baseline |
| As % of B50 mean post-tax income ($12,064) | 3.4% total / 1.7% above baseline |

The tariff-weighted regressivity ratio (Q1/Q5 as % of income) is **3.7×**.

### Interpretation

The B50's 28.8% share of tariff revenue *exceeds* their 11.1% share of pretax national income by 2.6×. This is because:
1. **Higher consumption-to-income ratio** — B50 spends a larger fraction of income on goods (vs. savings/investment)
2. **Higher share on tariff-exposed necessities** — food, clothing, and household goods are both import-heavy and income-inelastic
3. **Lower ability to substitute** — B50 consumers have fewer options to trade down or delay purchases

Combined with the $181.8B spending-cut impact from the CBO counterfactual analysis, the **total B50 fiscal burden is approximately $210B** ($181.8B spending cuts + $28.8B new tariff burden), equivalent to **$1,542/person or 12.8% of mean post-tax income**.

## Updated Caveats & Remaining Gaps

1. **FY2025 actuals still accumulating** — CBO baseline comparison uses estimated actuals for some categories.
2. **CPS ASEC 2024 reflects CY2023 income** — a pre-policy baseline, not the post-policy outcome. The 2025 ASEC (available ~September 2026) will provide the post-treatment comparison.
3. **Causal identification is partial** — CBO counterfactual provides strongest identification for spending gap; tariff incidence relies on Amiti et al. (2019) pass-through estimates; SDID framework established but requires panel data from multiple ASEC years for formal estimation.
4. **Income security decline includes post-pandemic normalization** — our placebo test (FY2019) helps distinguish policy from normalization, but a formal DiD with 2019-2024 panel would be stronger.
5. **CPI acceleration does not isolate tariff causality perfectly** — other supply-chain factors contribute; the Spearman correlation (ρ=0.684, p=0.020) provides supportive but not definitive evidence of pass-through.
6. **CEX quintile boundaries differ from CPS ASEC** — our B50 mapping (CEX Q1+Q2+0.25×Q3) is an approximation; a linked CEX-CPS analysis would be more precise.
7. **Gasoline price decline partially offsets tariff burden** — falling oil prices reduce the net tariff cost, but this is determined by global commodity markets, not tariff policy.
8. **For QJE/AER submission:** Need the CPS ASEC 2025 (post-treatment), formal SDID estimation with Clarke et al. (2023) estimator, and linked CEX microdata for precise tariff pass-through by household.

## Literature Review & Publication Roadmap

A comprehensive literature review is documented in `docs/literature_review.md` (40 references, 10 sections). Key positioning:

### Gap We Fill
No published work provides an integrated analysis of the 2025 U.S. fiscal changes — spending cuts, tariff escalation, and debt service growth — through a distributional lens focused on the bottom 50%. Existing papers study these channels in isolation (tariffs: Amiti et al. 2019, Fajgelbaum et al. 2020; spending: Wolff & Zacharias 2007; debt: Falkenheim 2022).

### Critical Upgrades Needed for QJE/AER

| **3** | Counterfactual | CBO baseline projections | CBO Jan 2025 baseline |
| **4** | Quantile treatment effects | QTE (Bitler et al. 2006) | Microdata |
| **5** | Robustness | Placebo tests, alt specs | Multiple |
