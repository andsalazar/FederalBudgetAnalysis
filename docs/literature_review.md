# Literature Review: Distributional Effects of Federal Fiscal Policy on the Bottom 50%

**Last updated:** February 2026  
**Purpose:** Position our paper relative to existing literature; identify methodological standards for top-5 journal submission (QJE/AER/JPE/ECMA/RES).

---

## 1. Introduction

This literature review covers six interrelated strands of research relevant to our central hypothesis — that the bottom 50% of U.S. taxpayers experienced net welfare losses from 2025 federal policy changes (spending cuts, tariff escalation, and debt service growth) while upper-income groups captured disproportionate benefits. We survey: (i) tariff incidence, (ii) distributional fiscal analysis, (iii) income/wealth inequality measurement, (iv) debt service and crowding out, (v) regressive taxation, and (vi) causal identification strategies in fiscal policy research.

## 2. Tariff Incidence and Consumer Price Pass-Through

### 2.1 Foundational Work: The 2018–2019 Trade War

The empirical literature on tariff pass-through was transformed by the 2018–2019 U.S.–China trade war, which provided the first large-scale tariff shock in a data-rich modern economy.

**Amiti, Redding & Weinstein (2019).** "The Impact of the 2018 Tariffs on Prices and Welfare." *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, 33(4), 187–210. [Cited by 1,617]
- Established the canonical finding of **complete pass-through** of U.S. tariffs into domestic import prices — foreign exporters did not absorb any of the tariff burden.
- Estimated consumer and firm losses of **$1.4 billion per month** from washing machine and steel/aluminum tariffs alone.
- Methodology: Difference-in-differences on unit values from U.S. Customs data, exploiting product-level tariff variation.
- **Relevance to our paper:** Validates our assumption that the FY2025 tariff spike ($195B, +153% YoY) translates near-completely into higher domestic prices. Their pass-through coefficient of ~1.0 is the benchmark our analysis should cite.

**Amiti, Redding & Weinstein (2020).** "Who's Paying for the US Tariffs? A Longer-Term Perspective." *AEA Papers and Proceedings*, 110, 541–546. [Cited by 294]
- Extended the analysis through October 2019, confirming **sustained complete pass-through** even as tariffs expanded to cover ~$350 billion of imports.
- Foreign export prices to the U.S. did not decline to offset tariffs.
- **Implication:** Pass-through does not diminish over time — our use of cumulative tariff revenue as a proxy for consumer burden is well-supported.

**Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy & Khandelwal (2020).** "The Return to Protectionism." *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, 135(1), 1–55. [Cited by 1,666]
- The landmark QJE paper on the 2018 trade war. Estimated that import and retaliatory tariffs caused **$51 billion in consumer/firm losses** (0.27% of GDP).
- Embedded estimated trade elasticities in a general equilibrium model with 16 sectors and 437 products across 3,111 U.S. counties.
- Found **large regional heterogeneity** — tariff costs fell disproportionately on agricultural and manufacturing regions that voted for Trump in 2016, creating a political economy paradox.
- Finds complete tariff pass-through to duty-inclusive prices.
- **Critical methodological lesson:** Top journals require general equilibrium modeling that accounts for regional heterogeneity and retaliation, not just aggregate price accounting. Our propensity-tagging approach is a step in this direction but lacks spatial/county-level granularity.

**Cavallo, Gopinath, Neiman & Tang (2021).** "Tariff Pass-Through at the Border and at the Store: Evidence from US Trade Policy." *American Economic Review: Insights*, 3(1), 19–34. [Cited by 608]
- Used retail scanner data (Nielsen) to trace tariff pass-through from customs to retail shelves.
- Found almost complete pass-through to **retail prices** (not just import prices), strengthening the case that tariffs function as a consumer tax.
- **Methodological innovation:** Matched customs HS10 product codes to retail UPC barcodes — the gold standard for tariff incidence measurement. We should acknowledge this level of granularity is beyond our current data but note it as an aspiration.

### 2.2 Contemporary Work: The 2025 Tariff Escalation

**Clausing & Obstfeld (2025).** "Tariffs as Fiscal Policy." NBER Working Paper No. 34192. [Cited by 4]
- Directly analyzes the fiscal implications of the 2025 tariff wave, arguing tariffs are an inherently regressive revenue instrument.
- Welfare costs estimated relative to 2024 baseline — directly parallels our FY2024→FY2025 comparison.
- **Connection:** Provides the theoretical framework for our H1c sub-hypothesis (tariffs as regressive tax).

**Clausing & Lovely (2024).** "Why Trump's Tariff Proposals Would Harm Working Americans." PIIE Policy Brief / SSRN. [Cited by 35]
- Demonstrates that the tariff proposals function as **regressive tax cuts partially financed by regressive tariffs**, creating a net regressive fiscal shift.
- Quantifies the distributional burden by income quintile.
- **Critical for our paper:** Provides the analytical framework linking tariff revenue to effective tax rate changes by quintile.

**Minton & Somale (2025).** "Detecting Tariff Effects on Consumer Prices in Real Time." Federal Reserve FEDS Notes. [Cited by 10]
- Estimates a **slope coefficient of 0.54** for tariff pass-through to consumer prices during the 2025 escalation — below the 1.0 complete pass-through found for 2018–2019.
- Suggests partial pass-through in the short run, implying our assumption of full pass-through may overstate immediate consumer burden but understate it if pass-through converges toward 1.0 over time.
- **Methodological note:** Uses high-frequency CPI microdata — a technique we could adopt for a revision.

**Gopinath & Neiman (2026).** "The Incidence of Tariffs: Rates and Reality." NBER Working Paper No. 34620.
- Studies both periods (2018–2019 and 2025) to compare pass-through dynamics.
- **Value:** Bridges the foundational 2018 literature with the current policy environment.

**Benguria & Saffie (2025).** "Rounding up the Effect of Tariffs on Financial Markets: Evidence from April 2, 2025." NBER Working Paper No. 34036. [Cited by 6]
- Event study of stock price responses to the April 2, 2025 "Liberation Day" tariff announcement.
- **Relevant to H1e:** Quantifies how tariff policy shocks affect equity values, which are concentrated among the top 10%.

### 2.3 Summary: What the Tariff Literature Tells Us

The literature establishes with high confidence that:
1. Tariffs pass through nearly completely to domestic prices (benchmark: ~1.0 for 2018–2019 tariffs).
2. The burden falls on consumers and importing firms, not foreign exporters.
3. The incidence is regressive because lower-income households spend a larger share on traded consumer goods.
4. QJE-tier papers require general equilibrium models with regional heterogeneity.

## 3. Distributional Effects of Federal Spending and Transfers

### 3.1 Theoretical and Empirical Foundations

**Wolff & Zacharias (2007).** "The Distributional Consequences of Government Spending and Taxation in the US, 1989–2000." *Review of Income and Wealth*, 53(4), 692–715. [Cited by 103]
- Introduced the **Levy Institute Measure of Economic Well-Being (LIMEW)**, which augments conventional income with the value of public consumption, public investment, and household production.
- Demonstrated that including government spending in income measurement significantly **reduces** measured inequality — the bottom quintile's share rises from 4.3% to 7.1%.
- **Methodological lesson for our paper:** Simply tracking spending levels misses the incidence question. We need to map budget categories to beneficiary quintiles, exactly as our propensity-tagging framework attempts. LIMEW is the gold standard we should reference.

**Bitler, Gelbach & Hoynes (2006).** "What Mean Impacts Miss: Distributional Effects of Welfare Reform Experiments." *American Economic Review*, 96(4), 988–1012. [Cited by 611]
- Demonstrated that **average treatment effects mask enormous heterogeneity** in welfare reform outcomes. Women at the bottom of the income distribution were hurt by welfare reform while those at the median benefited.
- Used **quantile treatment effects (QTE)** methodology to show distributional impacts.
- **Critical insight:** Our analysis currently reports mean changes in spending categories. A QJE-tier paper must examine distributional heterogeneity within the bottom 50% — e.g., the bottom 10% vs. the 30th–50th percentiles. QTE is the appropriate methodology.

**Danziger (1983).** "Budget Cuts as Welfare Reform." *American Economic Review*, 73(2), 65–70.
- Seminal work establishing the theoretical and empirical case that budget cuts to means-tested programs disproportionately harm the bottom of the income distribution.
- Analyzed the Reagan-era spending cuts and found that the bottom quintile bore 60%+ of the cuts' welfare costs.
- **Historical parallel:** Directly analogous to our H1a hypothesis about 2025 spending cuts.

**Elmendorf, Furman & Gale (2008).** "Distributional Effects of the 2001 and 2003 Tax Cuts: How Do Financing and Behavioral Responses Matter?" *National Tax Journal*, 61(3), 365–380. [Cited by 29]
- Key insight: **The distributional effect of tax cuts depends on how they are financed.** If deficit financing leads to future spending cuts in progressive programs, even seemingly neutral tax cuts become regressive.
- Modeled welfare losses from current and future financing of the Bush tax cuts.
- **Direct relevance:** Our finding that net interest ($880B) is approaching parity with safety-net spending ($988B) is precisely the "financing squeeze" this paper predicts. The interest-crowding-out channel in H1d is the mechanism they identify.

### 3.2 Distributional National Accounts

**Piketty, Saez & Zucman (2018).** "Distributional National Accounts: Methods and Estimates for the United States." *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, 133(2), 553–609.
- Created comprehensive distributional national accounts (DINA) that allocate 100% of national income to individual Americans.
- Key finding: The **pre-tax income share of the bottom 50%** fell from ~20% in 1980 to ~12.5% by 2014, while the top 1% share doubled from ~10% to ~20%.
- After accounting for taxes and transfers, the bottom 50% share is higher (~17%) but still declining.
- **Critical framework:** Our paper should use the DINA methodology to frame the "bottom 50%" — this is the QJE's own framework for measuring who the bottom 50% are and what they receive.

**Saez & Zucman (2020).** "The Rise of Income and Wealth Inequality in America: Evidence from Distributional Macroeconomic Accounts." *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, 34(4), 3–26. [Cited by 471]
- Updated and extended the DINA framework through 2019.
- Documented that **wealth concentration** has risen even faster than income concentration, driven by capital gains and stock market appreciation.
- The top 0.1% wealth share rose from 7% in 1978 to 18% by 2019.
- **Connection to H1d and H1e:** The rising concentration of financial wealth (stocks, bonds) means that policies enriching asset holders (interest payments to bondholders, stock market gains from deregulation and tariff exemptions) mechanically widen inequality.

**Saez & Zucman (2020b).** "Trends in US Income and Wealth Inequality: Revising after the Revisionists." NBER Working Paper No. 27921. [Cited by 113]
- Responded to methodological critiques (Auten & Splinter 2024) and defended the DINA finding of sharply rising inequality.
- Important scholarly debate to acknowledge: there is genuine disagreement about the *magnitude* of top income share increases, but not about the *direction*.

### 3.3 Wealth Concentration and Asset Ownership

**Bricker, Goodman & Moore (2020).** "Wealth and Income Concentration in the SCF: 1989–2019." Federal Reserve FEDS Notes. [Cited by 46]
- Using the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), confirmed that the top 1% held 38.5% of household wealth and the top 10% held ~76% by 2019.
- **Stock ownership concentration:** The top 10% held ~89% of directly and indirectly held equities. The bottom 50% held effectively zero net stock wealth.
- **Direct relevance to H1e:** Our finding that the S&P 500 rose +80.7% since January 2023 is a benefit captured almost entirely by the top decile. This Fed dataset is the authoritative source for that claim.

**Wolff (2022).** "The Stock Market and the Evolution of Top Wealth Shares in the United States." *Journal of Economic Inequality*. [Cited by 13]
- Quantified the **correlation between stock market valuations and top wealth shares**: a 10% increase in the Wilshire 5000 index corresponds to a ~0.8pp increase in the top 1% wealth share.
- **Implication for our paper:** The S&P 500's +81% gain is not just a "benefit to stock holders" — it mechanically drove a ~6.5pp increase in top 1% wealth concentration.

**Wolff (2024).** "Inflation, Interest, and the Secular Rise in Wealth Inequality in the United States: Is the Fed Responsible?" *Journal of Economic Issues*. [Cited by 3]
- Found that **rising interest rates and inflation** since 2021 have had distributional consequences favoring bondholders and harming borrowers.
- Used SCF microdata to estimate distributional impacts.
- **Connection to H1d:** Provides the microdata-based evidence that our macro-level finding (interest payments → bondholder enrichment) is empirically grounded.

**Batty, Bricker, Briggs et al. (2020).** "The Distributional Financial Accounts of the United States." NBER. [Cited by 37] / "Introducing the Distributional Financial Accounts." FEDS Working Paper. [Cited by 94]
- The Federal Reserve's official distributional financial accounts, linking Flow of Funds data to SCF wealth distributions.
- Provides quarterly estimates of wealth distribution by percentile — this is the authoritative data source we should use for the wealth concentration claims underpinning H1d and H1e.

## 4. Government Debt, Interest Payments, and Crowding Out

### 4.1 Theoretical Foundations

**Aiyagari & McGrattan (1998).** "The Optimum Quantity of Debt." *Journal of Monetary Economics*, 42(3), 447–469. [Cited by 770]
- Canonical model showing that government debt crowds out private capital accumulation through higher equilibrium interest rates.
- In their calibrated model, the optimal debt-to-GDP ratio was ~⅔ — well below current U.S. levels (~100%).
- **Mechanism relevant to H1d:** Higher debt → higher interest rates → larger interest payments → less fiscal space for progressive spending.

**Traum & Yang (2015).** "When Does Government Debt Crowd Out Investment?" *Journal of Applied Econometrics*, 30(1), 24–45. [Cited by 186]
- DSGE model showing that crowding out depends on which policy shock generates the debt — **transfer-financed debt crowds out less than tax-cut-financed debt**.
- **Nuance for our paper:** The composition of deficit spending matters. If the 2025 deficit comes from tariff-induced trade disruptions combined with spending cuts, the crowding-out dynamics differ from transfer-driven deficits.

### 4.2 Distributional Effects of Debt Service

**Falkenheim (2022).** "The Welfare Effects of Debt: Crowding Out and Risk Shifting." CBO Working Paper.
- Used an overlapping generations (OLG) model to estimate the distributional welfare effects of higher government debt.
- Found that **younger and lower-income cohorts bear a disproportionate share** of the crowding-out costs because they have fewer assets to benefit from higher interest rates.
- **Directly relevant to H1d:** Formalizes our intuition that interest payments transfer welfare from the young/poor (who bear crowding-out costs and receive fewer services) to the old/wealthy (who hold government bonds).

**Islam & Nguyen (2024).** "Distributional Crowding Out Effects of Public Debt." World Bank.
- Found that rising sovereign debt deepens inequality at the firm level — small firms are disproportionately crowded out of credit markets.
- **Connection:** Extends the crowding-out thesis from household welfare to labor market effects (small firms employ a larger share of lower-income workers).

**Pinardon-Touati (2021).** "Crowding Out Effect of Local Government Debt: Micro- and Macro-Estimates." [Cited by 41]
- Quantified the distributive effects of government debt on credit allocation at the firm level.
- **Methodology:** Instrument-variable approach exploiting institutional features of local government borrowing — a potential identification strategy template.

## 5. Regressive Taxation and Effective Tax Rates

**Saez & Zucman (2019).** *The Triumph of Injustice: How the Rich Dodge Taxes and How to Make Them Pay.* W.W. Norton. [Cited by 948]
- Provocative and influential argument that the U.S. tax system has become **effectively regressive** — the top 400 families pay a lower effective tax rate (23%) than the bottom 50% (24.2%) when all taxes (income, payroll, corporate, state/local, sales, property) are included.
- Computed comprehensive effective tax rates by income fractile from 1950 to present.
- **Key claim directly tested by our paper:** If the bottom 50% already face a higher effective tax rate than billionaires, and tariffs (a regressive consumption tax) are added, the regressivity intensifies further.
- **Scholarly controversy:** Summers & Sarin (2019) and Auten & Splinter (2024) dispute some of the incidence assumptions (especially corporate tax incidence falling on capital owners). Our paper should acknowledge this debate.

**Saez & Zucman (2023).** "Distributional Tax Analysis in Theory and Practice: Harberger Meets Diamond-Mirrlees." NBER Working Paper No. 31912. [Cited by 18]
- Provides the theoretical framework for comprehensive distributional tax analysis.
- Documents that the effective tax rate of the top 1% declined from ~50% in the 1950s to ~34% by 2018.
- **Methodological note:** This is the state-of-the-art in distributional tax analysis. Our paper should adopt their comprehensive incidence framework (allocating all taxes, not just federal income tax, to households).

**Splinter (2020).** "US Tax Progressivity and Redistribution." *National Tax Journal*, 73(4), 1005–1024. [Cited by 62]
- Presents the alternative view: the U.S. tax-and-transfer system is substantially progressive even after Saez-Zucman corrections.
- Key methodological contribution: defines the **redistribution rate** (taxes minus transfers as a share of market income) and shows it has been stable or slightly increasing.
- **Our paper should engage with both sides:** We report customs/tariff revenue increases as regressive — we should also acknowledge that Social Security and Medicare expansions are progressive offsets.

**Balkir, Saez, Yagan & Zucman (2025).** "How Much Tax Do US Billionaires Pay? Evidence from Administrative Data." NBER Working Paper No. 34170. [Cited by 11]
- Uses IRS administrative data (not surveys) to estimate billionaire effective tax rates at 10–15% of their full economic income (including unrealized capital gains).
- **Value:** Provides the most rigorous evidence base for the claim that the very top pays lower effective rates than the bottom 50%.

## 6. Trade, Labor Markets, and Regional Distributional Effects

**Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013).** "The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States." *American Economic Review*, 103(6), 2121–2168. [Cited by 6,956]
- The most-cited paper in modern trade-and-labor economics. Used commuting zones as the unit of analysis and an **instrument** (Chinese exports to other high-income countries) to identify causal effects of import competition.
- Found that rising Chinese imports caused **higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages** in exposed local labor markets. Affected commuting zones also received more government transfers.
- **Methodological gold standard:** The Bartik-style shift-share instrument (industry composition × national import changes) is the identification strategy most applicable to tariff studies. Our paper could adopt a similar approach using county-level variation in tariff exposure.
- **Substantive connection:** If 2018–2019 tariffs were meant to reverse the "China shock," they failed — they created new consumer price burdens without restoring manufacturing employment. The 2025 tariff escalation compounds this.

**Amiti, Kong & Weinstein (2021).** "Trade Protection, Stock-Market Returns, and Welfare." AEA Conference Paper. [Cited by 49]
- Event study examining stock price movements on tariff announcement days (2017–2019).
- Found significant negative effects on firms exposed to tariff costs and retaliatory tariffs.
- **Connection to H1e:** Provides a methodology for linking tariff events to equity market impacts and thence to distributional wealth effects.

**Khan, Zulfiqar & Chunjie (2025).** "Economic, Institutional, and Strategic Effects of Tariff Wars: Systematic Literature Review." *Journal of Economic Surveys*.
- Meta-analysis finding average GDP impacts of −0.5% and consumer price increases of +0.1% from tariff wars.
- **Useful for calibrating our models** and providing benchmark effects for the 2025 tariff wave.

## 7. Causal Identification in Fiscal Policy Research

The publication assessment identified **causal identification** as the single most important upgrade needed for QJE/AER quality. The literature offers several applicable strategies:

### 7.1 Difference-in-Differences (DiD)

**Alpino, Asatryan, Blesse & Wehrhöfer (2022).** "Austerity and Distributional Policy." *Journal of Monetary Economics*, 131, 73–91. [Cited by 38]
- Uses OECD austerity episodes as treatment and examines how fiscal consolidation affects redistributive policies.
- Key finding: **During austerity, countries tend to increase marginal tax rates on top earners** but cut transfers to the bottom, producing ambiguous net distributional effects.
- **DiD design:** Treatment = austerity episode (identified by IMF narrative approach); outcome = Gini coefficient, top marginal rate, transfer spending.
- **Template for our paper:** We could use policy-event dates (January 20, 2025 inauguration; April 2, 2025 tariff announcement) as treatment onset and compare trajectories of bottom-50% welfare indicators pre/post.

**Fremerey, Lichter & Löffler (2022).** "Fiscal and Economic Effects of Local Austerity." SSRN Working Paper. [Cited by 11]
- Exploited **quasi-random assignment** of German municipalities to austerity programs via regulatory thresholds, yielding a dynamic DiD design.
- **Identification lesson:** The cleanest DiD designs exploit institutional rules that create discontinuities in treatment assignment. For our paper, sudden policy changes (tariff announcements, executive orders) provide approximate "treatment dates" for ITS/RDD designs.

### 7.2 Synthetic Control Method (SCM)

**Škuflić, Vučković & Walter (2024).** "The Cost of Fiscal Austerity: A Synthetic Control Approach." *Ekonomski vjesnik*. [Cited by 2]
- Applied SCM to estimate counterfactual GDP trajectories absent austerity.
- **Relevance:** We could construct a synthetic counterfactual for "bottom-50% welfare" by weighting other OECD countries that didn't implement the same policy mix.

**Clarke, Pailañir, Athey & Imbens (2023).** "Synthetic Difference-in-Differences Estimation." *American Economic Review*, 113(12), 3425–3452. [Cited by 179]
- The state-of-the-art method combining the virtues of DiD and synthetic control (SDID).
- Developed by Athey & Imbens (Nobel laureate), making it the most credible identification strategy for policy evaluation studies.
- **Recommended approach for our paper:** SDID would be the most publishable identification strategy if we can assemble cross-state or cross-commuting-zone panel data on fiscal spending, prices, and lower-income outcomes.

**Adhikari (2022).** "A Guide to Using the Synthetic Control Method to Quantify the Effects of Shocks, Policies, and Shocking Policies." *The American Economist*. [Cited by 16]
- Practical guide to implementing SCM with placebo tests and inference.
- **Useful reference** for methodology section.

### 7.3 Interrupted Time Series (ITS) and Regression Discontinuity (RDD)

Our current approach uses ITS, which is appropriate for a working paper but insufficient for top-5 journals because it cannot distinguish the policy effect from other contemporaneous shocks. The literature suggests **augmented ITS** designs:
- Control series (placebo outcomes unaffected by the policy) to test parallel trends
- Multiple treatment dates to separate distinct policy effects
- Synthetic control augmentation (combining ITS with SCM donors)

---

## 8. CBO Distributional Analysis Methodology

**Perese (2017).** "CBO's New Framework for Analyzing the Effects of Means-Tested Transfers and Federal Taxes on the Distribution of Household Income." CBO Working Paper. [Cited by 6]
- Describes the official CBO methodology for distributional analysis: start with CPS ASEC microdata, augment with IRS SOI administrative records, impute underreported transfers, allocate federal taxes by economic incidence.
- **Key insight:** The average federal tax rate for the lowest quintile rises substantially when means-tested transfers are excluded — showing how sensitive distributional conclusions are to the definition of "income."
- **We should adopt the CBO framework:** Using CBO's published quintile-level data as our distributional backbone, rather than building independent estimates. This is both more credible and more efficient.

**Habib (2018).** "How CBO Adjusts for Survey Underreporting of Transfer Income in Its Distributional Analyses." CBO Working Paper. [Cited by 13]
- Documents that CPS ASEC **underreports** transfer income (SNAP by ~35%, SSI by ~45%, Medicaid by ~25%), which leads to understating how much the bottom quintile benefits from government programs.
- CBO's adjustment methodology uses administrative data to correct.
- **Important caveat for our paper:** If we use unadjusted CPS data, we will understate both the baseline benefit level and the magnitude of cuts.

**Habib & Heller (2022).** "Current Work on the Distributional Analysis of Household Income Resulting from Policy Changes." CBO Working Paper. [Cited by 4]
- Extends the CBO framework to analyze the distributional effects of **specific policy changes** (rather than just static snapshots).
- **Directly applicable:** This is the methodology we should emulate — compare the distribution of household income under the 2025 policy changes versus a CBO-baseline counterfactual.

**Harris, Perese & Shakin (2016).** "Frameworks for Distributional Analyses." AEA Conference Paper.
- Discusses alternative frameworks (pre-transfer income, post-transfer income, market income) and how the choice of framework affects measured distributional impacts.
- **Our paper should be explicit** about which framework we use and conduct sensitivity analysis across frameworks.

## 9. Synthesis: Positioning Our Paper

### 9.1 What Exists

The literature has established, with strong empirical support:

| Finding | Key Papers | Quality of Evidence |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Tariffs pass through ~100% to domestic prices | Amiti et al. (2019, 2020), Fajgelbaum et al. (2020), Cavallo et al. (2021) | Very strong (QJE, JEP, AER:I) |
| Tariff incidence is regressive | Clausing & Lovely (2024), Clausing & Obstfeld (2025) | Moderate (policy briefs) |
| Bottom 50% income share has declined to ~12.5% | Piketty, Saez & Zucman (2018), Saez & Zucman (2020) | Very strong (QJE, JEP) |
| U.S. tax system is approximately flat or regressive | Saez & Zucman (2019), Balkir et al. (2025) | Debated but influential |
| Stock/bond wealth concentrated in top 10% | Bricker et al. (2020), Wolff (2022), Batty et al. (2020) | Very strong (Fed data) |
| Government debt crowds out investment | Aiyagari & McGrattan (1998), Traum & Yang (2015) | Strong (JME, JAE) |
| Budget cuts disproportionately harm bottom quintile | Danziger (1983), Bitler et al. (2006) | Strong (AER) |
| Fiscal austerity has complex distributional effects | Alpino et al. (2022), Komarek (2020) | Moderate |

### 9.2 The Gap Our Paper Fills

**No published work yet provides a comprehensive, integrated analysis of the 2025 U.S. fiscal policy changes — simultaneously examining spending cuts, tariff escalation, and debt service growth — through a distributional lens focused on the bottom 50%.**

Specifically:

1. **Timing:** The 2025 tariff escalation, DOGE-era spending cuts, and interest rate environment are all *concurrent* and *interacting*. Existing papers study these channels in isolation (tariffs: Amiti et al.; spending: Wolff & Zacharias; debt: Falkenheim). No paper examines the **joint distributional effect** of all three.

2. **Channel integration:** Our propensity-tagging framework (HIGH/MID/LOW spending beneficiaries) provides a novel way to aggregate heterogeneous fiscal channels into a single distributional impact estimate. This fills the gap between macro-level budget analysis and micro-level distributional accounts.

3. **Real-time analysis:** By using monthly Treasury data and FRED indicators, we provide **near-real-time** distributional assessment of ongoing policy — analogous to Minton & Somale (2025) for tariff prices but applied to the complete fiscal picture.

4. **Interest-crowding-out-social-spending nexus:** While Falkenheim (2022) models crowding out theoretically and Elmendorf et al. (2008) discuss financing effects, our finding that interest payments ($880B) now equal 89% of safety-net spending ($988B) is a striking empirical fact that has not been documented or analyzed in the academic literature.

### 9.3 Where We Fall Short of QJE/AER Standards

| Gap | What Top Papers Do | Our Current Status | Priority |
|-----|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| **Causal identification** | DiD, synthetic control, IV, RDD, SDID | ITS (descriptive) | **Critical** |
| **Microdata** | CPS ASEC, CEX, SCF, IRS SOI, Nielsen scanner | Aggregate macro data only | **Critical** |
| **General equilibrium** | Trade models with >400 products, regional variation | Budget function aggregates | High |
| **Counterfactual** | CBO baseline projections, synthetic control donors | Pre/post comparison only | High |
| **Robustness** | Multiple specifications, placebo tests, sensitivity to assumptions | Single specification | High |
| **Welfare measurement** | LIMEW, equivalent variation, QTE | Dollar spending levels | Moderate |
| **Period of analysis** | Multi-year panels | FY2019–FY2025 (short) | Moderate |

## 10. Methodological Roadmap: From Working Paper to QJE

Based on the literature, here is the concrete path from our current working paper to a top-5 submission:

### Phase 1: Data Upgrade (Weeks 1–4)

1. **CPS ASEC microdata** (Census Bureau, annual March supplement)
   - Provides household-level income, transfers, demographics
   - Enables computation of income by quantile, transfer receipt by program
   - Alvaredo et al. (2020) and Piketty et al. (2018) use this as a primary source
   - Available through 2024; 2025 supplement available spring 2026

2. **Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX)** (BLS, quarterly)
   - Required for tariff incidence analysis: expenditure shares by income quintile for tariff-affected product categories
   - Cavallo et al. (2021) methodology requires this for welfare calculations

3. **Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)** (Fed, triennial)
   - 2022 wave is latest; provides wealth distribution, asset composition, stock ownership by percentile
   - Bricker et al. (2020) framework; needed for H1d (who holds government bonds?) and H1e (who benefits from equity gains?)

4. **CBO distributional data** (already partially collected)
   - Quintile-level federal tax rates, transfer receipt, market income
   - Perese (2017) framework; use as baseline for counterfactual

### Phase 2: Identification Strategy (Weeks 3–8)

**Recommended approach: Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SDID)**

Following Clarke, Pailañir, Athey & Imbens (2023):

1. **Unit of analysis:** U.S. states (50 + DC) or commuting zones (741)
2. **Treatment:** States/CZs differentially affected by 2025 policy changes
   - Tariff exposure varies by import-competing industry shares (Autor-style Bartik instrument)
   - SNAP/Medicaid cuts vary by enrollment rates and state policy choices
   - Interest income benefits vary by wealth concentration
3. **Outcome variables:**
   - Median household income (ACS 1-year)
   - SNAP enrollment and benefit levels (USDA administrative data)
   - CPI-U for the region (BLS)
   - Unemployment rate by education level (CPS)
4. **Counterfactual construction:** SDID constructs a synthetic "untreated U.S." from pre-treatment trends

**Alternative: CBO baseline counterfactual**
- Use CBO's January 2025 baseline projections as the "no-policy-change" scenario
- Compare actual FY2025 outcomes to CBO projections
- Difference = policy effect (this is the Habib & Heller 2022 approach)

### Phase 3: Analysis Upgrades (Weeks 6–12)

1. **Quantile treatment effects (QTE)** — following Bitler et al. (2006)
   - Estimate distributional impacts at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th percentiles
   - Test whether harm is concentrated at the very bottom vs. spread across bottom half

2. **Welfare computation** — following Fajgelbaum et al. (2020)
   - Convert spending/price changes to equivalent variation (EV) in dollars
   - Report welfare loss per household by income quintile

3. **Decomposition** — following Saez & Zucman (2023)
   - Decompose total distributional impact into:
     - (a) Direct spending changes (safety net reductions)
     - (b) Tariff-induced price increases (regressive consumption tax)
     - (c) Interest payment diversion (opportunity cost of social spending)
     - (d) Equity market gains (asset holder enrichment)

4. **Robustness checks:**
   - Alternative propensity classifications (sensitivity of results to HIGH/MID/LOW cutoffs)
   - Different CPI deflators (CPI-U vs. CPI-W vs. PCE)
   - Placebo tests: run same analysis on non-policy years (2016–2019)
   - Pass-through sensitivity: 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 pass-through coefficients
   - Exclusion of pandemic-era normalization effects (use FY2019 baseline instead of FY2020)

### Phase 4: Framing and Submission (Weeks 10–16)

**Target journals (in order of fit):**

1. **QJE** — Best fit given Fajgelbaum et al. (2020) and Piketty et al. (2018) precedent. QJE publishes trade-and-distribution and fiscal policy papers with strong identification.

2. **AER** — Bitler et al. (2006), Autor et al. (2013) both AER. Requires the strongest identification strategy.

3. **AEJ: Economic Policy** — Ideal if we can't achieve full causal identification but have compelling descriptive + quasi-experimental evidence.

4. **Journal of Public Economics** — Strong fit for fiscal incidence analysis.

5. **Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (BPEA)** — Accepts timely policy analysis with less restrictive identification requirements; Saez & Zucman (2019) published progressive wealth taxation there.

**Working paper venues (immediate):**
- NBER Working Paper (requires NBER affiliation or co-author)
- SSRN (immediate, no restrictions)
- Brookings Economic Studies (policy brief format)
- Tax Policy Center (if focused on H1b/H1c)
